I am a second-year [Digital Humanities Ph. D.](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/eddh-digital-humanities/) candidate at [EFPL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and a Research Assistant in the [Social Computing Group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/social-computing) at [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Gatica-Perez](https://www.idiap.ch/~gatica/). In addition, I recently accepted to be part of the [EPFL PhD Excellence program](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/doctoral-studies-structure/customized-curricula/epfl-phd-excellence-programme/)'s [3rd cohort](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/doctoral-studies-structure/customized-curricula/epfl-phd-excellence-programme/cohort-3/).

I am working on designing and developing data-assisted participatory decision-making computational systems/tools for urban security missions, together with multiple European cities and NGOs, following a human-centered methodology as part of the [IcARUS](https://www.icarus-innovation.eu/) project, funded under the European Union H2020 program.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist in Product Development and Algorithm Development team at [Ground Inc.](https://en.groundinc.co.jp/), Tokyo, after graduating as a [Computer Science Engineer](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/computer-science-engineering) from [Mahindra Ã‰cole Centrale](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/school-of-engineering) with a thesis on Adaptive Critic Design for Extreme Learning Machines. After a spell at Ground Inc., I finished a [Digital Humanities MSc](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/digital-humanities/) at EPFL with a thesis on creating a system to search for famous artwork patterns in children's drawings and an internship at [Institut national d'histoire de l'art](https://inha.fr/fr/index.html), Paris for the [Richelieu. Histoire du quartier](https://www.inha.fr/fr/recherche/le-departement-des-etudes-et-de-la-recherche/domaines-de-recherche/histoire-des-collections-histoire-des-institutions-artistiques-et-culturelles-economie-de-l-art/richelieu-histoire-du-quartier.html) program.

I am broadly interested in the application of Data Science in social/political science alongside creating education solutions and political empowerment. Here is a [small interview](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/dh-creates-the-chance-to-re-create-re-present-and-/) where I talked about my interests.

I am keen on collaborations, so if you have similar interests or think I can be of any help with your work, please feel free to drop me a message!

If you are interested in a a semester/thesis project using data science and machine learning for research in the intersection of social media, urban computing, computational democracy and data journalism, feel free to email me.
