title: Structural Similarities And Differences In Chinese Folk Songs
description: This study explored the structural differences in Chinese Folk Songs and compared their similarity across various geographical regions. The analysis of scale degrees distributions and intervals reveal deep cross-regional similarities. However, the pitch transition asymmetries with respect to the metrical weights show that some regions clearly distinguish from the others. Overall, the findings highlight the directedness of music across all the examined regions.
