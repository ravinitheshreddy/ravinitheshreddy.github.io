title: Hollywood and Pentagon Relationship
description: This project investigated the relationship between the Department of Defense of the United States of America and Hollywood. The results show that Hollywood receives the support of costly and military-related paraphernalia from the top agencies of the DoD and in return sheds good light on DoD in the movies. Simultaneously, DoD cast off the movies that narrated uncomfortable stories about the United States.
